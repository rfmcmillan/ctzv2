## Usage

To give a brief overview of how I have organized the user interface, I've arranged all of the company's settings just below the navbar and the company's name. Below that, you will find a list of the company's sites on the left. If you wish to see more details about a site, you can click the button at the right end of each site's row. This will populate the site's information in the component to the right. This information includes the site's active products and a slider to adjust the timing of the Script Load Delay Setting.

On the "Terms of Service" page, you will find a Default Terms of Service and a Custom Terms of Service component. For the Custom Terms of Service component, I unfortunately did not have time to build a back-end to create a way to save the file in a database but the component does present how the UI of such a feature would work.

If there are any problems getting the app up and running or if there are any other issues at all, please don't hesitate to contact me at rfmcmillan@gmail.com and hopefully I can provide a quick-fix.
